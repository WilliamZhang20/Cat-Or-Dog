# Cat Or Dog

Using logistic regression on a single perceptron to distinguish between cat and dog images.

The dataset is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog), but since all images are of different sizes, they had to be all resized to be 80 x 80, and padded to ensure consistency.

Work in progress.
